In this folder you will find all the files required to compile and simulate the 3 FC layers.
In each folder you will find two subfolder and for the simulation you can refer only to the testbench one. Inside this subfolder there are several .txt files required for the simulation to feed the testbench and to compare results.

Follow this steps:
 
1) Go into FCx/Testbench_FCx;
2) Launch simulation of FCx_tb with "compile.do" script.
3) Run "FCx.m" MATLAB script;
4) You will see MATLAB graph comparing the results.
